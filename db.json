      "shoutout": "Daniel de Boer is a composer, bassist, and singer from The Netherlands. His music is an eclectic mix of cultures and styles that come together in the pop idiom. Music that is, in short: world pop.",
      "bio": "Recording an album of his original songs had long been a dream for Daniel. In the summer of 2020, he found time to work on sketches for nine compositions. A year later, he moved to Valencia to pursue a master's in performance at Berklee Valencia, where he collaborated with Indian producer Shakthi Prasad. Together, they approached musicians from around the world, gathering a diverse group from over 16 countries. The resulting album blends pop with world music genres, featuring instruments like the diatonic accordion, lyra, oud, and oriental percussion. Each musician brought their unique touch, creating a distinct and personal sound.",

Her previous singles, \"Lilac\" and \"Sway,\" received critical praise for their hard-hitting atmospheric soundscapes and mystic lyrics, garnering acclaim from respected publications such as Earmilk, Atwood Magazine, and Ladygunn.",
